## Train Directory

This directory holds all the source files and script files for training a strong classifier using AdaBoost with 5 weak classifiers. Run the demo script with 
```
./demo
```
to make a strong classifier from the weak classifiers in the main directory (/classifiers/weak/). Make sure there are at least 5 weak classifiers in the directory before running.
