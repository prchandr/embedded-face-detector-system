A basic test of the classifier using a single feature and a single image.
These are located within the test case in the classifiers directory
and the images directory.

classifiers/ is the directory that holds the strong classifier files. The 
classifier files must be in the appropriate structure and filename.

images/ is the directory that holds the images to classify. The names of
the images must be a zero-padded integer that fits in XXXX.png.

classifierSelect.txt holds the indices of the classifiers to use in the 
cascade.

imageSelect.txt holds the integers of the images to classify.

The results of each of these classifications is written to results.txt.
