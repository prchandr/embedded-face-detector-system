## Getting Dataset
The images used for training and testing are obtained from a dataset based on the MIT CBCL dataset, found [here](https://github.com/paveyry/FaceDetection/tree/master/learning-tests). 

Download the images by navigating to the project directory and running the 
```
idxupdate project-dataset
```
on the DICE command line, or simply running the **`setupDataset.sh`** script.
